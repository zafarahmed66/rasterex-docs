RxView360 relies on several third-party JavaScript libraries that must be referenced in the HTML source along with rxcorefunctions.js:

- jQuery: [https://jquery.com/](https://jquery.com/)
- three.js: [https://threejs.org/](https://threejs.org/)
- Foxit SDK: [https://developers.foxitsoftware.com/](https://developers.foxitsoftware.com/)

A file called `barebone.html` is included with the RxView360 distribution that demonstrates a minimal setup.
