RxView360 relies on several third-party JavaScript libraries that must be referenced in the HTML source along with rxcorefunctions.js:

- three.js: [https://threejs.org/](https://threejs.org/)
- PDF.js: [https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/)

A file called `barebone.html` is included with the RxView360 distribution that demonstrates a minimal setup.
